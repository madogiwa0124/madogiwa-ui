# Commit Message Guidelines
- Commit messages must be written in English.
- Use Conventional Commits format
  - Prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`
  - Example: `feat: add new button component with accessibility features`
- The first line of the commit should summarize the changes (recommended within 50 characters). Leave a blank line, and from the third line onward, provide detailed explanations of the Why and specifics of the changes.
